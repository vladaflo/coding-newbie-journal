let defaultLunch = "pizza"

// we assign the variable myLunch the value of specialLunch (if it contains a String) or defaultLunch (if it does not)
print("My lunch on Monday \(myLunch).")
// when printing the value of myLunch, we see the default value â€” "pizza," since specialLunch is equal to nil

// when we assign the value "meat pie" to specialLunch and then use the nil-coalescing operator, the value of specialLunch is unwrapped and transferred to myLunch.
