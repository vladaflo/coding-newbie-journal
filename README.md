# Ð¡oding Newbie Journal

Welcome to my coding journey! I'm a newbie programmer learning Swift, and this repository is where I share my progress, projects, and code examples.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains various projects and code snippets that I have worked on as I learn and improve my Swift programming skills. Each project or snippet is organized into its own directory with detailed explanations.

## Table of Contents

## Code Examples

- **if-and-repeat-while-loop:** Basic syntax, practical examples, and detailed comments on using the if conditional expression and the repeat-while loop in Swift.
- **nil-coalescing-operator:** This code contains an example demonstrating the use of the nil-coalescing operator (??) in Swift, with detailed comments explaining each step.
- **using-array-properties-swift** An array has properties, which are variables or constants containing some information about it. See how these two properties are used in the following if-else statement.
- **switch with enums** In Swift, enumerations (enums) are a powerful feature that allows you to define a common type for a group of related values.
- **enums with raw string values and the CaseIterable protocol** Let's explore the Swift code example that uses an enumeration (enum) with raw string values and the CaseIterable protocol.
- **sorting an array of integers using a closure** To sort an array of integers in Swift using a closure, you can use the sort(by:) function, which takes a closure as a parameter to define the sorting order.
